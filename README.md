# Disaster-AI Web App

### Overview:
Disaster-AI is a web application that provides real-time, relevant responses to user queries during disasters using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. The app allows users to ask disaster-related questions and receive accurate information instantly. Key features include:

- **Text-based query input**: Users can type questions about disaster relief, safety tips, or other calamity-related concerns.
- **Real-time responses**: The system fetches relevant content using a large language model (T5-large).
- **Web-based platform**: Accessible on any browser with a clean, easy-to-use interface.
- **Potential offline functionality** (future update).

### Features:
- **Quick Help via Text Box**: Users input questions in a text box and receive instant responses.
- **Calamity-Specific Information**: Users can ask questions on various aspects of a disaster, from preparedness to recovery.
- **Real-time, Accurate Responses**: The app utilizes a RAG-based approach to ensure responses are relevant and timely.
